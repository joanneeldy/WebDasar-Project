                <p>I am a 18 year old IT enthusiast that loves learning and teaching
                    with a hardworking and goal-oriented personality. I'm currently
                    teaching primary and secondary students while attending my bachelor

                <p>I am also a kpop lover, with my ultimate girl group is stayc.

                     of <a href="https://kprofiles.com/park-sieun-stayc-profile-facts-ideal-type/">Sieun</a>,

                <p>The members of stayc are all so cute and talented such that it's difficult
                    for me to pick a bias. However, I finally found someone that I really like
                    when I was looking at their fancams, and my ultimate bias in stayc is <b>ISA</b>. 
                    I found her very attractive and always have that overflowing
                    charm and unique charisma on stage that keeps the audience eyes on her.
                    She was born on 2002 which makes us a year of age difference. 
                    A fun fact: We share the same MBTI, which is <u>ESFJ</u>.
